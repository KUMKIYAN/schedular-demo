schedular-demo

Schedular is part of Spring core. so need of any dependancy. 

    @SpringBootApplication 
    @EnableScheduling 

This Scheduling will be enabled at the time of junit implementation as well. Create different configuration class for scheudling there we can use conditional on property annotation. on which scheduling should be enabled.

On top the method use @Scheduled 

@Scheduled(fixedRate = 2000L) Assume that this method take almost 5 Seconds to complete. Method will execute for every 2 seconds irrespect whether method complete or not. notice the below output

@Scheduled(fixedDelay = 2000L).

    it will execute once method is complete. then wait for 2 seconds. notice the below output

@Scheduled(fixedRate = 2000L, initialDelay = 2000L). This will start after the application start and wait for 2 secondns then start the job for every two seconds

@Scheduled(fixedDelayString = "PT2S"). this is another way where we run 2 seconds after method execution 

@Scheduled(fixedRateString = "PT2H"). this is another way where we run for every 2 hours.

P represent Period T represent Time S represent seconds H represent hours for doucmentation google

Give the values in properties. so for any change we no need to touch the code.

@Scheduled(cron = "*/2 * * * * *") it is working like fixed delay. after method execution after 2 seconds it is working. Use https://crontab.guru/

When we have more than one @Scheduled only one thread is allocated to run two jobs. which is not effective.

use this spring.task.sheduling.pool.size = 10 to allocate more than one thread
